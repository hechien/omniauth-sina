# OmniAuth Sina

This gem contains the Sina strategy for OmniAuth.

The base strategie is fork from omniauth-oauth gem, and fix the problem at this patch that sina weibo does not return call_back_confirmed params when get request token.

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 1.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-sina'

You can pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-sina', :git => 'https://github.com/mrichie/omniauth-sina'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :sina, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret" 
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Sina Weibo[api.t.sina.com.cn] (they call them API Key and Secret Key). 

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
